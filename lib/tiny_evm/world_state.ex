  @moduledoc """
  A simplified World State represented by `Ïƒ` in the Yellow Paper.

  This implementation only supports passing a small subset of
  the Ethereum Common VM Tests, so the World State is implemented
  as a mapping between accounts represented as strings and
  the account's state represented as a map. A full implementation of
  the EVM will maintain the World State in a modified Merkle Patricia Trie as
  a mapping between 160 bit addresses and RLP serialized account states.
